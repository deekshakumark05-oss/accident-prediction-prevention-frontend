\# Accident Prediction and Prevention – Frontend



This repository contains the frontend of the Cloud-Based Accident Prediction and Prevention System developed as an academic project.



The frontend provides an interactive user interface that allows users to register, log in, perform manual accident risk prediction, upload CSV data for analysis, view prediction results, check wallet rewards, and access prediction history.



The frontend communicates with a cloud-hosted Flask backend through REST APIs. All prediction logic, data processing, and database operations are handled by the backend, while this module focuses on user interaction and visualization.
